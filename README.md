### Hi there, I am Simon Doy ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page.

I am founder and owner of [iThink 365](https://www.ithink365.co.uk) who specialise building stuff for our customers on the Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Azure platforms.
My background is in both Infrastructure and Development, though over the last few years I have been concentrating on Development and Solution Architecture. I generally build stuff in .NET and TypeScript using Angular or React frameworks.

My interests in development centre on how to build maintainable and manageable solutions so I am always looking at things like Dev Ops, Instrumenting code and how to build things in a cleaner way. I talk more about those things on my [blog](https://www.simondoy.com).

Finally, I am also a core member of the [Maturity Model for Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/community/microsoft365-maturity-model--intro) team.
Thanks for visiting!
